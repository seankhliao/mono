##### _12024-10-04_ Visions of Atlantis

With [_SERAINA TELLI_], and [_ILLUMISHADE_]

[_SERAINA TELLI_] was fine, nothing that really caught my attention.
[_ILLUMISHADE_] was better I think?
[_Visions of Atlantis_] was what I was here for,
fully committed to the pirate theme,
there was quite a bit of audience involvement too,
though maybe less singing and more pumping fists and shouting.
It was quite a melodic experience that reminded me of a turbulent ocean.

##### _12024-10-02_ AURORA

As dreamy as you would imagine,
[_AURORA_] put on an amazing show at the Royal Albert Hall,
which couldn't have been a better choice of venue.
You know it's all eyes on her, when the band's been sequestered to the side,
and the stage is wide open with just her in the center.
The dreamy style did fall away towards the end with a more joyous
celebration of... something.

##### _12024-09-03_ girl in red

With [_Nieve Ella_]

I forgot to review [_gitl in red_]'s music before the show,
but that didn't really take away from the experience.
What sort of experience was it?
It felt slightly less scripted than usual for an event this size,
more like a smaller more intimate show.
But... with a few thousand people jumping around,
I don't think that counts as intimate.
It was pretty fun, I was up close to the front,
and with a crowd that was majority female,
I could actually see the stage.

##### _12024-08-28_ WACK in the UK Vol 3

With [_MONSTERIDOL_], [_BiS_], and [_ASP_]

Idol culture, not something I get to see a lot of here in the UK.
I get the sense that you don't go to these for great music,
either the audio or my ears were clipping the entire night,
but more for the experience,
both with the actual idols but also the other fans.
It's also very much a visual affair,
the choreography is what we're here for.
[_MONSTERIDOL_] looked traditionally cute,
and also had the most interaction with the audience (better english?).
[_BiS_] had the most individually distinct appearance,
which was quite refreshing.
I liked the music of [_ASP_] the best,
though with 7 people on stage it was quite crowded on the small stage
and a bit hard to focus on specific people.
Visually, coordinated and... hardcore?

##### _12024-08-04_ Animangapop London

This was a much smaller event than I expected...
but also with a much younger crowd of what looked like mostly teens
doing the cosplay?

##### _12024-07-21_ Hyper Japan Festival 2024

With [_Akase Akari_]

This is a London event about Japanese things in general,
though if you walk around you'll find the ground floor is:
media/entertainment companies, pens, sake, other food,
and some assorted other stuff.
The second floor is a marketplace:
mostly independent sellers with cute stuff.
The crowd fills in over the course of the day,
it's never quite packed,
though like all conventions,
it's wise to keep your distance (for the sake of your nose).
A decent portion of people dress up for the event,
either matching japanese fashion or full on cosplay.
This time,
[_galacticbpd_]'s Death Note Misa cosplay with a giant scythe
was my favorite.
In between walking around,
there were the on stage performances.
[_Akase Akari_] was cute performing her ending theme for
My Dress Up Darling,
her cosplay skills were quite on point channelling Marin Kitagawa.

##### _12024-07-03_ Against the Currrent

With [_Dead Pony_]

When a band that can sell out a 2400 people venue
goes on stage at a 600 one in short notice,
you know it's going to be good.
I think the mosh pit opened up behind me from the second song,
pausing only for the acoustics.
After all these years,
[_Against the Current_] is still my favourite band,
the sound, the energy just gives me life.
I feel revitalized after an honestly mostly mediocre first half of the year,
and this is going to keep me going through a summer without anything of interest.
Not attached to any specific album,
this set drew from the best,
and further back in the past as well.

##### _12024-06-21_ Charlotte Sands

With _Emi Jeen_ and _AJA_

I certainly felt the hype ramping up through the three sets.
[_Emi Jeen_] was fine,
I felt like I got [_Tate McRae_] vibes from [_AJA_],
and [_Charlotte Sands_] was more heavy into rock (I think).
Quite the energetic night, I think I missed being on the floor in the front.

##### _12024-06-18_ AViVA

With _Air Drawn Dagger_

_AViVA_ was... different than what I expected.
I didn't really like the sound mix for the live version,
I guess I liked the studio versions better?
I couldn't really tell what exactly I was listening to.

##### _12024-06-16_ IVE

My eardrums almost burst with the amount of screaming I heard from the
_IVE_ fans...
This time, I prepped for a two whole days listening to their songs,
and I think it paid off,
I was familiar with what felt like over half of them.
Of course, being kpop, the visuals were probably the important part
and they didn't disappoint either.

##### _12024-06-10_ ATARASHII GAKKO!

Fun, though _ATARASHII GAKKO_ didn't feel like it fell into any particular genre.
I did feel like a lot of the songs sort of blended together,
but maybe that was from all the pre-listening I did the day before.
Maybe digital pop?
I think the visual component was a big part of it,
not just the sound.

##### _12024-05-29_ Spirited Away

The second time I was seeing the _Spirited Away_ stage adaptation,
this time higher up and further away.
Maybe it broke the magic a little to see more of how things were acted out,
especially places where I didn't notice there were body doubles.
Since the last time, I had rewatched the original animation.
Still it was pretty good.
[_Kanna Hashimoto_] as Chihiro, [_Kotaro Daigo_] as Haku.

##### _12024-05-28_ Allie X

Electronic music?
_Allie X_ was certainly interesting.

##### _12024-05-01_ Spirited Away

The [_Spirited Away_] stage adaptation was such a magical experience.
Even though it had been forever since I'd seen the original animation,
this brought back so many memories.
The set design was wonderful,
as was the masterful use of the rotating set piece,
who knew that a single odly shaped half building could turn into so many locations.
I cannot sing enough praises for the actors,
there was so much emotion,
that even though it was all in japanese and I kept having to glance at the subtitles on the side,
it didn't really distract me.
The lavishness of the setup and costumes left me in awe of the whole thing.
The fact that the puppeteers didn't hide at all were an endearing part of the show.
[_Mone Kamishiraishi_] as Chihiro, [_Kotaro Daigo_] as Haku.

##### _12024-04-24_ ITZY

I can't say that I was really in to their music,
I just saw an ad on the tube and thought why not....
There were a lot of screaming fans,
I hope my eardrums are still ok.
The performance itself was quite glitzy,
with every part choreograhed with good dances.

##### _12024-04-23_ Tate McRae

With [_charlieonnafriday_]

[_Tate McRae_] slayed the evening with a mix of song and dance.
There was some alternating between fast and slow songs,
which was different from the usual fast-slow-fast sandwich.
The singing was good,
though with heavy use of prerecorded parts,
enabling some more energetic routines.
It was interesting to see there was a fan in the center to make her hair flow in the wind,
really reinforcing the glamour look.

##### _12024-03-25_ Madison Beer

Such a lovely performance,
This was another one with the entire crowd singing along
for most of the songs.
There was a cutesy elegance to [_Madison Beer_],
which I felt was a bit unique compared to all the other shows
I've recently seen.

##### _12024-03-19_ Cannons

With [_NINA_] and [_Radio Wolf_].

Relaxed, cool, and sensual was the vibe tonight with [_NINA_] and [_Radio Wolf_].
Much like [_Cannons_] though I'd replace relaxed with laid back.
It wasn't intense, but still had a positive, upbeat feel.
I was honestly surprised that not many people seemed to be dancing...

##### _12024-03-09_ Cloudy June

With [_King Mala_].

I didn't have high hopes, but [_Cloudy June_] was pretty good,
apparently I knew quite of few of her songs.
I remember first noticing her from a very slow, sad song,
but this set was mostly fairly energetic.
Though the lighting was bad when I wanted to get pictures...

##### _12024-02-29_ RØRY

With [_lleo_] and [_Uninvited_].

Sadcore? I guess that's the genre we're in now.
[_RØRY_] was interesting but it just never felt quite aligned to what i was feeling.

##### _12024-02-22_ Zara Larsson

With [_Yaeger_].

Chill and energetic,
not quite words that go together,
but that was the overall vibe I got from [_Yaeger_].
It was fun, relaxing, and got us all hyped up for Zara.
[_Zara Larsson_] came in popstar style,
with the usual 4 backing dancers and giant screen in the back.
With only a slight lull in the middle,
it was high energy singing and dancing,
both on the stage and in the crowds.
So fun.

##### _12024-02-20_ Poppy

With [_Wargasm_].

We open the night with a mosh pit,
and we have one for almost every song (well mostly electronic sounds).
It makes me wonder if I should have gone down into the stalls instead
for [_Wargasm_].
[_Poppy_] was a bit softer on the electronic,
but I liked it better, with the higher dynamic range.
It did feel a bit impersonal with the chatter in-between being pre-recorded,
at the same time, very on brand.
The dancing felt a bit in the uncanny valley,
but overall a pretty good time.

##### _12024-02-16_ Alessandra

Pop music is back on the schedule,
this time with Norway's Eurovision 2023 representative [_Alessandra_].
It was good, though not particularly special,
just an energetic night out.

##### _12024-01-26_ Mystery Ensemble

Some light instrumental music from the Witcher game and tv series.
Maybe I wasn't paying enough attention but I may not have recognized
most of it.
At least it was mostly pleasant.

##### _12023-12-16_ FEMM

We open with 2 Japanese mannequins in latex maid costumes carried on stage.
[_FEMM_] was a very visual performance,
the robotic moves of the first part,
the slightly more fluid but still precise and fully choreograhed remainder of the show.
With their last show outside of Japan,
the crowd was a bit smaller than expected, though there was an afternoon show as well.

##### _12023-12-09_ Halestorm

With [_Black Veil Brides_], and [_Mothica_]

I came to see [_Mothica_] and I was not disappointed.
My favourite dress I've seen this year, maybe vampire core?
For her style of music, it was a bit different from the recordings,
maybe a bit less clarity and more backing vocals?
But it felt emotional.
[_Black Veil Brides_] were... fine I guess?
[_Halestorm_] were... cool.
It felt old school rock and roll,
no need for flashy stage props,
just a clean, empty stage, with lights and music.

##### _12023-12-08_ Communion Xmas Party

With [_Nectar Woode_], [_Bear’s Den_], [_Christof Van Der Ven_], [_Jack Garratt_],
[_Jasmine Jethwa_], [_Lucia & the Best Boys_], [_Maisie Peters_], and [_The Staves_]

Film music, and explicitly not christmas music or films,
though 2 christmas songs did sneak through,
hosted by Communion Records.
It was quite a joyous occasion,
though with the age of the artists and them referencing their "teenage dreams",
I don't think I recognized too many songs.
[_Maisie Peters_] was awesome as always,
[_Lucia_] was someone I might consider listening to again.

##### _12023-12-01_ Against the Current

With [_Call Me Amour_] and [_LØLØ_]

I started off wondering if this was the same [_LØLØ_] that I had seen a few months before,
but the second half of her set did awar with those thoughts.
Fun and energetic.
Seeing [_Against the Current_] again brought me a warm, comforting feeling
as if I were coming back home (they were the first band I was really into).
So much energy, this is really a show you should be in the stalls for.
Chrissy's stage presence has changed a bit I think,
less plain left/right movements, more bending down;
also she reminded me of a lion...
To top it all off, they ended with Legends Never Die,
the song that made me think: "i wonder who's behind this",
and pick up on music as a thing.

##### _12023-11-30_ Ashnikko

With [_Hemlocke Springs_]

I honestly had no idea what was going on during the support act.
[_Ashnikko_] on the other hand was amazing.
It was more of a pop/dance style performance,
and I loved the little (mildly disturbing) stories she used to introduce each song.
I knew more of these than I expected,
and even jumped around a bit.
Very fun.

##### _12023-11-24_ Chloe Adams

With [_ili_]

The glaswegian accent from _ili_ was so cute to listen to,
definitely recommend.
[_Chloe Adams_] was an interesting mix of styles.
I came here after hearing Seasons too many times on ticktock,
the live version did not disappoint
(though the crowd was much smaller and quieter than I expected).

##### _12023-11-20_ Echosmith

With [_McKenna Michels_] and [_Larkins_]

I think _McKenna Michels_ was fine?
Slightly on the slower, sadder side,
which was in contrast to the positive personality.
[_Larkins_] sounded like a typical pop/rock band,
not very memorable, I may have drifted off for a bit.
It really was a dream for me to see [_Echosmith_],
they were one of the first bands I was into,
and by the time I got around to seeing live shows,
I didn't think they were still active.
Anyway, the music was amazing,
brought back so many memories.
Though I did think I should have refreshed my memory of their discography beforehand.
Soft pop/rock, it felt like a gentle embrace,
and throwback to a more carefree time.

##### _12023-11-09_ Melanie Martinez

With [_UPSAHL_]

I get to see [_UPSAHL_] again,
what's not to love?
We open with a barrage of pop,
slow down for a few sad songs,
then get back into fast paced music.
[_Melanie Martinez_] on the other hand felt quite different.
It felt less about the music
(whuch was different from the more dreamy style in recordings),
and more the entire experience of the show.
Every single moment felt planned and choreograhed,
there was no small talk besides a thank you to mark the encore,
and more thank yous at then end;
each piece flowed into the next,
and the use of the digital backdrop in combination with physical setpieces
was quite impressive.

##### _12023-11-03_ Maisie Peters

With [_Gretta Ray_]

[_Gretta Ray_] was slow(er) sad(der) pop.
What went through my head was:
she looks a bit like taylor swift?
[_Maisie Peters_] was way better than I expected.
Usually I don't care too much for the talk between the songs,
but the cute, bubbly energy she gave off was infectious.
The music was different from the recordings,
but in a richer kind of way,
and I was pleasantly surprised by how many songs I knew.

##### _12023-11-02_ Fall Out Boy

With [_Nothing, Nowhere_] and [_PVRIS_]

[_PVRIS_] felt a bit off...
compared to the many times I saw them this year.
The start of each song felt a but raw,
but generally ended strong.
[_Fall Out Boy_] was very flashy.
Lots of big sets and props,
like a spinning starfish, a giant talking dog, and just stuff on stage.
Also plenty of fireworks and flames.
As for the music,
I felt a distinct lack of bass or just lower frequencies in general.
Being around for as long as they have,
there was quite a bit I've never hear of,
the ones I knew were just the popular ones that bookended the set.

##### _12023-10-25_ deathbyromy

With [_July Jones_]

I might have stood too close to the stage and half the time all I heard were drums...
Halfway through I really did wonder if I was at the right place,
I obviously hadn't gone through _deathbyromy_'s discography beforehand,
but it was still an interesting evening of loud alt music.

##### _12023-10-03_ ari abdul

With [_Deadbeat girl_]

babydoll was the song stuck in my head all summer,
and it was great seeing [_ari abdul_] perform it live.
There was definitely a difference between the sweet quiet parts
and the louder, coarser parts we don't get in the recorded version.

##### _12023-09-13_ eundohee

With [_Sadie Fine_], and [_Chloe Levaillant_]

[_Sadie Fine_] was... fine? I came for the one song on my spotify playlist (Detox),
and got it. Others sounded a bit rougher than expected.
[_Chloe Levaillant_] was my favourite of the trio,
it felt calm and relaxing, giving off ocean or forest vibes.
[_eundohee_] was ok? It took a bit for me to catch on what language I was listening to...

##### _12023-09-07_ flamenco

Lively, and loud clapping,
but I can't say I understood the singing parts.

##### _12023-08-29_ UPSAHL

With _clarence_

[_UPSAHL_] was one of my favourite shows last year,
and it is most definitely making the list this year.
The atmosphere was what can only be described as electric,
even the slow songs turned into energetic dances.
The crowd sang almost every song,
thankfully we didn't have to jump for every one,
but when we did, it was fun.
Standing at the front edge,
there's definitely peer (crowd?) pressure to join in,
plus you get to have Taylor lean into your personal space...

##### _12023-08-28_ All Points East

With [_Kaeto_], [_Unflirt_], [_Mae Stephens_], [_Isabel LaRosa_], [_Valencia Grace_], [_Nieve Ella_],
[_Griff_], [_Paris Paloma_], [_girl in red_], and [_HAIM_]

I wandered into the festival grounds and saw an empty main stage,
wondering where everyone was and if I got there too early.
Making my way to the other end,
I saw [_Kaeto_] who set the mood for the rest of the day.
[_Mae Stephens_] I was wondering who that was until she got to her last song,
If We Ever Broke Up, and I doubted if I could ever escape the repetitive tiktok musoc.

[_Isabel LaRosa_] was coverying BABYDOLL as I approached the stage,
in the set were quite a few covers of songs currently at the top of my playlist,
I loved it.
[_girl in red_] was just as good as I remember,
maybe slightly more relaxed than last time,
still very active and jumpy.
[_HAIM_] sort of had a face of shock for most of their performance,
I didn't really know their songs,
but it was still enjoyable.

##### _12023-08-19_ Field Day

My legs were sore after this.
I feel like I could sort of distinguish between things I liked
and things I didn't,
but it did sort of all blur together a bit too much.

##### _12023-07-04_ Oslo Danse Ensemble

A ballet performance in Oslo.
GONE felt like a collection of scenes,
no strong single thread of a narrative,
but pretty overall.
THE RING felt stronger story wise,
though I can't say I enjoyed the music as much.
Both felt modern-ish,
with a bit more focus on expression,
and less on precision choreography.

##### _12023-07-02_ Blackpink

With [_Sabrina Carpenter_], [_Rebecca Black_], [_The Rose_], [_Peach PRC_], [_Caity Baser_], and [_Annika Bennett_]

[_Annika Bennett_], the sad songs set of the festival,
but I liked it.
Cool and relaxing.
[_Caity Baser_] had a joyous african/caribbean vibe(?)
Not bad, but not my jam.
[_Peach PRC_] was, by contrast, wilder, with fairy wings and catchy songs (I think).
[_The Rose_], a K-POP boy band,
it was fine I think.
Just fine.
[_Rebecca Black_] felt like forever trying to outrun a dark history (Friday...),
which came back as a remix(?) in the penultimate song.
I'm not sure what I was expecting, but she gave off a feeling of wanting to be more mature.
[_Sabrina Carpenter_] I could barely see her on stage (sooo many people),
but I still loved the set.
I think her speaking voice was slightly deeper than expected,
singing was just like the records.
[_Blackpink_] was... so much screaming and singing from the fans.
I think I recognized a surprising number of their songs,
and the visuals were over the top in a good way.
High production at its best.

##### _12023-06-20_ Beth McCarthy

With [_lleo_], and [_carpark_]

I think the music for the night was fine.
[_Beth McCarthy_] was palpably excited.

##### _12023-06-13_ Taylor Acorns

With [_Uninvited_]

Active, intense.
I don't think I've heard much of [_Taylor Acorns_] songs before then,
but it was good fun for the night.

##### _12023-06-09_ PRINS

With [_Jayd Marie_], [_Detweiler_], and [_Lekna_]

My hopes weren't high when I saw the venue was one of the smaller ones,
but it was surprisingly good.
Catchy and energetic,
with a cooperative audience that danced along.

##### _12023-06-06_ Royal Philharmonic Orchestra

With [_Aisling McGlynn_]

A concert of video game music played by an orchestra,
it was as amazing as it sounds.
Having been to way too many rock converts recently,
it was a good reminder that there are a lot of other instruments
than a guitar, bass, and drums.
A few moments were, "oh so that's how those sounds were made".
To top it off was the ethereal voice of [_Aisling McGlynn_]
for some truly memorable songs.

##### _12023-06-03_ PVRIS

Apparently already my third [_PVRIS_] show of the year.
This time an acoustic solo session by Lynn.
It's lovely to hear the focals so clearly.
And the contrast between her voice in talking (soothing),
and singing (strong?), is just so cute.

##### _12023-05-27_ Slam Dunk Festival

With [_LØLØ_], [_Scene Queen_], [_Charlotte Sands_], [_Maggie Lindemann_], and [_PVRIS_]

With 5 main stages (3 of which were double stages with to minimize downtime),
I thought I'd have a nice variety,
but I pretty much ended up just staying at a single stage for most of the day.
[_LØLØ_] was a fun, energetic performance that set the mood.
[_Scene Queen_] was interesting (bimbocore?),
though I'm not sure if I'd voluntarily listen to it again.
[_Charlotte Sands_] was once again a set I loved,
noticeably messier this time.
[_Maggie Lindemann_] was who I came for (front row anyone??).
A solid, powerful voice, though with less deviation from studio versions.
And finally, [_PVRIS_] on the main stage,
maybe I was too far on the edge but the crowd didn't feel as into it,
but I enjoyed it.

##### _12023-05-25_ Cherry Dream

I think the real audience for [_Cherry Dream_] was just me and 4 other people,
with everyone else being either one of the performances
or staff.
Slightly uncomfortable experience tbh.

##### _12023-05-17_ Nessa Barrett

With [_briskin_]

In a narrow room with bright lights (Heaven is a nightclub after all...),
I could barely see [_Nessa Barrett_] through the crowd,
but the show itself was still great.
Sad-ish pop songs hits the feels,
and the audience sang along for almost all of it.
An experience for sure.

##### _12023-05-09_ Avril Lavigne

With [_phem_]

[_phem_] was... fine?
Not bad, but also not especially memorable,
besides the oversized mask she came on stage with.
[_Avril Lavigne_] on the other hand... so many memories.
Someone next to me said:
"everyone here either has Avril as a childhood hero or childhood crush",
and i could totally believe that.
There were a lot of throwbacks in the music,
and they weren't perfect deliveries of the studio versions,
they all had that live twist.
Every song was a hit,
and i think this ranks among the best show i've been to this year along with [_PVRIS_].

##### _12023-04-30_ Harvey Parker trust: love in mind

With [_Clean Bandit_], [_Chineke Orchestra_], [_National Children's Orchestra_], and more

The launch event for a trust dedicated to the mental health of artists (musicians).
There was a wide range of shows,
some things that I can appreciate, like orchestras,
and others that I wouldn't go see on its own (spoken word, solo instruments).
Of course the highlight was the final performance,
a combination of the orchestras, a choir or two,
and [_Clean Bandit_].
It was a full, rich sound,
but I can't help but feel the distinctness I expected was drowned out by everything else.

##### _12023-04-26_ girli

With [_Louis III_]

Chill, smooth were the vibes I got out of [_Louis III_],
good, but doesn't really hook me in.
[_girli_] on the other hand felt better than expected,
with contrast between the quiet and loud parts.
It was... therapeutic.

##### _12023-04-22_ Delain

With [_Xandria_]

[_Xandria_] was... noise like a stormy day,
with a ray of sunshine piercing through the clouds.
Or at least that was what I thought of the vocals,
and a bonus point of the voice being more like an instrument
is that they don't ask the audience to sing along.
Compartively, [_Delain_] was a more rowdy,
less contrasty affair.
Popular sounding, but less distinct.

##### _12023-04-19_ Ava Max

With [_Emlyn_]

[_Ava Max_] was pure pop ecstasy,
fun and energetic throughout,
though it did seem to lean more heavily into dance compared to a pure music show.
The music was a pretty faithful reproduction of the recorded versions,
with a heavy mix of backing vocals.
Oh, and for some reason, there was a dense population of gay male couples.

##### _12023-04-15_ Skillet

With [_Eva Under Fire_], and [_Like a Storm_]

I think [_Eva Under Fire_] was one of the bands that YouTube just decided I must like one day,
and it wasn't wrong.
Their live performance was a pretty faithful rendition of the recorded versions.
[_Like a storm_] was... meh. I never really got into it,
and it sort of just blended together into the background.
[_Skillet_] started off strong with energy and flashy visuals,
but somewhere around the halfway point,
they lost of a bit of momentum and never quite recovered.

##### _12023-03-29_ Emlyn

With [_Beth McCarthy_]

I loved the support act,
enegetic, excited, yet it gave off a relaxed overall vibe
that was just pleasant to be around.
On the other hand,
from the moment [_Emlyn_] came on,
it was a full on intense barrage.
It felt a bit too much for a full night,
but it was great for the more popular songs where the audience sang along.

##### _12023-02-17_ Anna of the North

With [_Rebmoe_], and [_Eden Hunter_]

We start with a digiatl bedroom vibe,
feels a bit like a throwback.
Then into some pop, which was fine.
Finally, we have [_Anna of the North_].
There's a nervous/excited energy in the air and I'm there for it.
The only reason I'm here has been Youtube's constant recommendations of her music videos,
I guess they were worth it.

##### _12023-02-16_ Zoey Lily

With [_Elena Flury_]

Best described as a chill night out,
away from the banging drums I've been hearing for the past few weeks.
Both [_Elena Flury_] and [_Zoey Lily_] had beautiful voices,
makes me want to look for more acoustic sessions.

##### _12023-02-14_ Caroline Polachek

Heavy on the visual imagery,
this was I think a night of pop music.
There was a DJ set as support,
still don't know who it was.
As for the main event, [_Caroline Polachek_]
it felt good, but not amazingly memorable.

##### _12023-02-11_ XYLØ

This was a much smaller show than I expected, with no support act.
Also, I happened to be surrounded by the friends and family group,
which was interesting.
The show by [_XYLO_] was great,
though the start/end of it all was sudden.
Mostly what I remember from the released versions,
and it didn't hurt that I was right up at the edge of the stage.

##### _12023-02-09_ Sonia Stein

We start with a singer songwriter, she was good.
Then a band, which....
had a feel of compressed audio where everything is just full blast all the time.
And finally, the star of the show, [_Sonia Stein_].
I think it was pretty much what I heard from spotify, but live.

##### _12023-01-27_ Kimbra

A very synthetic(?) show by [_Kimbra_]
Lots of effects up to a point
where I couldn't quite tell associate the action I saw with the sounds I heard.
Also, quite a bit of talk about inner self and reflection,
but I guess that's par for the course for album launch events.

##### _12023-01-26_ PVRIS

With [_Maggie Lindemann_], and [_Charlotte Sands_]

One of the shows where I loved every part.
[_Charlotte Sands_] opened with what felt like boundless energy,
I expected nothing less and wasn't disappointed.
[_Maggie Lindemann_] was in comparison more muted.
A softer performance that ramped up as it went on,
I think slightly hindered by "not my audience".
And [_PVRIS_], I'd been looking forward to this for almost a year.
By the second song there was a mosh pit which generally didn't let up until the very end.
It felt like every song was a hit,
bringing back good memories and making new ones.

##### _12023-01-24_ Kings Elliot

With [_Sophia Alexa_]

An evening of sad, but not depressing, songs.
The show opened with someone quite forgettable.
Act II by [_Sophia Alexa_] felt refreshingly better,
upbeat in contrast with the lyrics,
mixing in a hint of country.
The headliner, [_Kings Elliot_], brought a much fuller experience.
A rich sound that draws in your attention.
I don't think there could have been a better end
than the final song with strings accompaniment.
It rounded off the night so well,
like everything before but turned up to 11.

##### _12023-01-17_ Sofar Sounds

An impulse decision to go in the middle of a
[work kickoff week](https://seankhliao.com/blog/12023-01-15-snyk-kickoff-2023/#-day--3).
Last minute reveals of location and artists to try and build an air of mystery?
60 people in a bar, all seated.
Michael Bird - singer guitarist: not bad, but not really memorable either.
Woodzy - poet: I wasn't expecting a poet for the night,
but with puns abound, it was the best part of the night.
Ruth Brown - singer: a powerful voice,
but I did wonder if the tonal variations were in there just for the sake of it.
Also, way too loud with the audio systems turned up.

##### _12022-12-09_ Pierce the Veil

With [_Against the Current_]

[_Pierce the Veil_] was the headliner, and they obviously had a very excited crowd.
The performance felt more spectacle than music,
with smoke screens, confetti, flying guitars, and general acting out.
Something I've noticed with support acts is
they usually get the short end of the stick in terms of lighting,
and it detracts from the experience a bit.
I also felt like [_Against the Current_] weren't quite all in for this show...

##### _12022-12-03_ Halocene and Halflives

This was fun, and I was jumping around quite a bit for both of these.
I witnessed crowdsurfing and playing a song again for the music video.
As the final show of the tour, you can see them all letting go and just enjoying it.
[_Halflives_]'s music seemed most aligned to my taste,
while [_Halocene_] seemed a bit more all over the place.

##### _12022-11-24_ UPSAHL

With [_Lizzie Esau_], and [_Eyelar_]

[_UPSAHL_] certainly knows how to leverage a live show to create an experience.
Apparently I liked a lot of her songs.
The live versions don't aim to be pitch perfect recreations of the studio versions,
but emotion filled variants enhanced by the stage presence.

##### _12022-11-15_ Nina Nesbitt

With [_LonelyTwin_], and [_Katelyn Tarver_]

[_Nina Nesbitt_] counts as pop (I think), but it's slower than I expected.
Not bad, but not amazing either.

##### _12022-11-10_ renforshort

With [_Valencia Grace_]

Such an exciting little show.
Not sure what I was expecting,
but this was fun and energetic,
and actually knew most of the [_renforshort_] songs.
Maybe a bit of it is just standing in with the crowd instead of sitting up somewhere far away,
but I loved it either way.

##### _12022-11-06_ Frayle

Another small bar / music venue,
all the scary looking people outside made me wonder if I had walked down the wrong alley.
2 heavy metal bands, then... witch metal? alchemy?
For all 3 bands, many of the songs just felt the same,
with no real differentiation.

##### _12022-11-05_ The Pretty Reckless

With [_The Cruel Knives_]

[_The Pretty Reckless_] were amazing.
For once, I felt the music pull its weight,
and going to the show is a balance of the music and the experience.
The songs were revitalizing and the crowd was hyped for them.
I think this is the frequency I'm on, I havent changed much since I found them.
O2 Academy, circle front center off right.

##### _12022-11-03_ The Rasmus

With [_Overlaps_]

It was okay for the night, but I thought _The Rasmus_ bit bland.
The songs sound like they should have energy,
but I just wasn't really in tune with them.

##### _12022-09-16_ BANKS

With [_Maeve_]

The roundhouse, as the name suggests, is round, and gives off circus vibes.
This is the second show I've been to where there are 2 backup dancers dancing around,
they still feel a bit weird...
The lighting felt on point, cementing our focus on Banks.
Alternating between high energy and slow (love?) songs,
overall the show by [_BANKS_] a bit of a throwback for me (Gemini Feed).

##### _12022-08-25_ Nadeah

This show by _Nadeah_ was set in a cozy little bar,
a little reminiscent of times past.
Halfway bwteen acoustic and rock.

##### _12022-07-29_ London Grammar

Outdoor festival, and with a song catalogue that's a bit ethereal.
Hannah of [_London Grammar_] forgetting the lyrics to a song (and feeling bad about it) is fine,
the joy she shows when the crowd also forgets the lyrics to another song
makes it much more human.

##### _12022-07-26_ The Seagull

A theatre show, superfically about playwrights,
but maybe really about feelings around success (or lack thereof).
I went into this blind,
having picked the show based on the lead [_Emilia Clarke_].
There are no fancy settings,
just a box, chairs and actors who never leave the stage.

##### _12022-06-29_ Billie Eilish

With [_girl in red_]

Seated centre back in an arena full of screaming teenage girls (and their guardians)...
The songs flowed well into each other,
and even with the high production experience, it didn't feel artificial or detached.
With a crowd this size, they could just be an amorphous blob,
but it didn't really feel that way,
maybe except when [_Billie Eilish_] stands to take in the adoration showered onto her.
Bonus points for coming out much closer to the crowds in a swinging crane arm.

##### _12022-05-19_ Charli XCX

With [_Yeule_]

We're into the more mainstream hyperpop territory, and it shows.
[_Charli XCX_] polished high production with more focus on the performance and spectacle,
less on the music and crowd.

##### _12022-05-15_ Fletcher

With [_Gracey_], and [_UPSAHL_]

In a female domninated (90+%?) audience,
I stuck towards the back of the crowd near the sound tech.
[_Fletcher_] certainly knew who her fans were,
addressing the crowd directly.

##### _12022-04-10_ Against the Current

With [_Halflives_], and [_Yours Truly_]

After a pandemic and a move to country with way more events,
guess who's back first?
Around mid centre in the crowds, the energy is as high as ever.

This time I actually knew the openers:
[_Halflives_] were very similar to [_Against the Current_],
working up the crowd in a similar fashion (high energy bounces).
[_Yours Truly_] had a slightly stronger metal lean(?),
I think it took a while for people to recognize them from their songs.

##### _12019-12-08_ Against the Current

[_Against the Current_] again, this time I got VIP tickets because why not?
That got me a 2(?) acoustic performances, a poster, and a photo op.
In the crowd, close to front,
the energy levels are high.

##### _12019-03-19_ Against the Current

[_Against the Current_] is one of the first bands I learned to recognize by name,
for this show I sat on the upper floot and mostly just enjoyed the music.
[_Chrissy Costanza_] is a bundle of energy bouncing around the front of the stage.
