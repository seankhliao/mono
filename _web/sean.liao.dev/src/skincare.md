Notes on skincare products I tried.

#### lip balm

People keep commenting on my dry lips

##### Eucerin

Easily available in Europe.
These are gel like.

###### Eucerin Acute Lip Balm

This was pretty decent.

###### Eucerin Aquaphor SOS Lip Repair

This is probably the best from the Eucerin products.
Keeps my lips moist for a long time

###### Eucerin Aquaphor Protect & Repair Salbe

I think this technically isn't a lip balm,
but it works pretty well too.

###### Eucerin Aquaphor Healing Ointment

Also not a lip balm but works just as well.

##### Rohto Mentholatum

A Japanese brand.

###### Rohto Mentholatum Deep Moist Fragrance Free

This works pretty well for a solid lip balm.

###### Rohto Mentholatum Melty Cream Lip Fragrance Free

This one feels ok at first but its effect doesn't last that long.
Lips still end up dry after a few hours.

#### moisturizers

###### Rohto Mentholatum Hada Labo Shirojyun Premium Whitening Lotion

Current preferred lotion.

###### Rohto Mentholatum Melano CC Vitamin C Milky Lotion

Doesn't seem to do much for me.

#### other

###### The Ordinary Retinol 1% in Squalane

Skin is really sensitive to this...
Effects not clear.

###### The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%

It does give a soothing feel.

###### Rohto Mentholatum Melano CC Vitamin C Brightening Premium Essence

I think it does work to a degree.

###### Lion Pair Acne Cream

Initially I thought it worked really well.
But later I'm less sure about it.
