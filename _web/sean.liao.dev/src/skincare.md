Notes on skincare products I tried.

#### lip balm

People keep commenting on my dry lips

<!--
##### Curel

###### Curel Intensive Moisture Care Moisture Lip Care Cream
-->

##### Eucerin

Easily available in Europe.
These are gel like.

###### Eucerin Acute Lip Balm

This was pretty decent.

###### Eucerin Aquaphor SOS Lip Repair

This is probably the best from the Eucerin products.
Keeps my lips moist for a long time

###### Eucerin Aquaphor Protect & Repair Salbe

I think this technically isn't a lip balm,
but it works pretty well too.

###### Eucerin Aquaphor Healing Ointment

Also not a lip balm but works just as well.

##### Rohto Mentholatum

A Japanese brand.

###### Rohto Mentholatum Deep Moist Fragrance Free

This works pretty well for a solid lip balm.

###### Rohto Mentholatum Melty Cream Lip Fragrance Free

This one feels ok at first but its effect doesn't last that long.
Lips still end up dry after a few hours.

###### Rohto Mentholatum Medicated Lip Stick

It's really stiff at first, though seems to be better after some use.
Still hard to get it to rub off on my lips, especially when wet.
It also has that intense cooling feeling when you put it on.

#### moisturizers

###### Rohto Mentholatum Hada Labo Shirojyun Premium Whitening Lotion

Current preferred lotion.

###### Rohto Mentholatum Melano CC Vitamin C Milky Lotion

Doesn't seem to do much for me.

#### other

###### The Ordinary Retinol 1% in Squalane

Skin is really sensitive to this,
use too much and the skin peels.

###### The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%

It does give a soothing feel.

###### Rohto Mentholatum Melano CC Vitamin C Brightening Premium Essence

I think it does work to a degree if used consistently.
No immediate impact though.

###### Lion Pair Acne Cream

Initially I thought it worked really well.
But later I'm less sure about it.
