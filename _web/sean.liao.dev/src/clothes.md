## notes on brands on clothing items

### _clothes_

Note to self on clothing items I may need to rebuy in the future.

#### Jacket

_Rains Long Jacket_
Light, packable, kind annoyed mine has a hole from when it got caught on a fence.

_The North Face Canyonlands hoodie_
it was fine but kinda thin especially in the pockets.

_Fjallraven Keb Fleece Hoodie M_
very comfortable, i like it,
but too hot for summer.

#### Shirt

_Uniqlo Airism Button Down Short Sleeve_
pretty comfortable,
but a bit slow drying / hot in the summer.

#### Trousers

_Ministry of Supply Going Places Pant_
really liked these, lasted for 4ish years of near daily wear.

_Ministry of Supply Men's Kinetic Tapered Pant_
they were good, but I really didn't like the drawstrings.

_Fjallraven Vardag lite trousers_
stiffer than I'd like, tore after tripping.

_Western Rise Evolution Chino_
slightly stiff,seams came apart after a few months.

_Ministry of Supply Men's Velocity Dress Pant_
once again very comfy, 
has a soft cotton(?) feel that makes it feel a bit more delicate.

_lululemon ABC Slim-Fit Trouser 30"L Warpstreme_
decently comfy, feels stiffer than the MoS Velocity.

#### Socks

_Darn Tough Tactical 4066_
pretty comfortable, a bit thick for summer.
The insides do seem to gradually lose fluff.
And one or two of them seem intent on rotating on my foot.

_Icebreaker Merino Hike+ Medium Crew Socks_
I don't really like that they have left/right socks
and they can be pretty thin in some places (around the ball of the foot).

#### Shoes

_Timberland Premium 6-Inch Lace-Up Waterproof Boot_
these lasted me quite a while,
but they never recoevered their pure black after some work in muddy fields.

_Clarks_ some kind of chelsea boots,
pretty comfortable.

_Allirds Wool Runner-up Mizzles_
The wool toor a hole pretty quickly.

_Hoka Hoka Clifton 8 Running Shoes_
they're ok?

_Clarks Foxwell Up GTX_
fine, though i got tired of the zip.

_Clarks Clarkdale Hall_
comfy until i wore down the heels.

_Dr Martens 2976 Bex Smooth Leather Chelsea Boots_
platform shoes that do take some getting used to.
I think they loosed up more than i expected.

#### Underwear

_Uniqlo Airism Boxer Briefs_
go to.

_Uniqlo Airism Mesh Ultra Seamless Boxer Briefs_
they feel really smooth...
but less comfortable around the crotch.

#### Pillows

_NightComfort Rebounce_
said to be from the same manufacturer as the ones Premier Inn uses?
Switching to this eliminated most of my back pain on my current bed
(my old pillows were fine on my old bed...).
