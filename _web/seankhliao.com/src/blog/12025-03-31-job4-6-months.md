### _job4_ 6 months

February kicked off with a team offsite in Miami, Florida, US.
That was fun, well Miami was OK,
but getting to meet team members was definitely helpful to get to know them.

The other stuff I did was:
* Run some vendor software, 
  and work through their issues of them using a SaaS and not understanding how their software actually worked,
  and them having made poor choices that they decided to revert.
* Make resource adjustments
* Handle incidents
* A lot of housekeeping, cleaning up legacy
* Get renovate automerge approved and deployed so we see less reviewer load
* Convince coworkers that CPU limits (at least very low ones) are bad
* Work through p2p syncing issues
* A lot of internal infrastructure / deployment migrations
* Code reviews for Go code
