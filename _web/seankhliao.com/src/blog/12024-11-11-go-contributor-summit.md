### _go_ contributor summit

I was at the [Go contributor summit](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/80MFrZwsHgU)
hosted by GoLab in Florence, Italy.
Here I met a few members of the Go team at Google (Russ, Alan, Damien, Dmitri, Tatiana),
as well as some of the Europe based contributors (Filippo, Daniel Marti (mvdan), Alessandro Arzilli (aarzilli), Nicola Murino (drakkan), Jorropo, Jan Merci.

The morning was the actual "summit" part,
split into 2 tracks from the ideas people brought up on the spot.
For the sessions I was in,
it was light on hard technical details 
and instead dealt more with social issues.
Things like what it's like for external (non Google) maintainers,
priorities, reviews, maintenance load, 
and the contributor->maintainer pipeline.

The afternoon was a meet the Go team event with more end users(?) of Go.
Question quality varied a bit though there wasn't anything too exciting.

As usual, all the fun discussions happened in the "hallway" track,
in the more 1-1 style chats with each member.
Like getting a feel for where `go fix` is going,
what's on the table for `net/http` changes,
`gaby` feedback,
and a deep dive into build/release and gerrit/luci.

Overall, it was quite a bit more interesting than I was expecting.
