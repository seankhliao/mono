## migrations and a team change

### _job3_ 22 months

I feel like so much happened in the last 2 months.
Phase 2 of our migration got significantly delayed,
I can't help but feel that this was because everyone was spooked
when things didn't go smoothly during a practice run where
another engineer and I were both on vacation...
In the free time that we suddenly gained,
there was a lot of work on polishing up the automation for things,
mostly in Go because the first part I wrote in Go.

Then came 3 weeks off trying not to think about work.
I thought I could get some open source stuff in,
but it was not to be.

The second half,
I joined a different team,
thinking it would be: "work on reliability for the monolith".
It ended up being more: "work on release engineering for the monolith".
I think I've had enough staring at CircleCI and Node/NPM for a few years.
