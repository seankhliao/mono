### _job3_

#### _state_ of the world

I'm once again the youngest in a team of 5 SREs...
Where are all the young people?
Anyway, our team is spread across 3+ (depending on travels) countries,
and I've yet to meet any of them in person.
I have met some other people in the time I'm in the office,
averging 2 days per week,
where I appear to be sandwiched between quite a few (great+) grand bosses.

On tech: GCP, AWS, K8s... a pretty standard modern cloud stack.
So far, the scope of my work covers the observability stack,
alerting, and incident response management
(the process, but not necessarily being the responder).
Is something always broken? Yes.
Are there perma-firing alerts? Yes.
Am I going to be fixing tech debt for the next 6months-1year? Maybe.
I'm observing an inclination towards rewrites rather than maintenance,
and with time broken up by sprints,
there appears to be quite a bit of context switching and pivots.

#### _do_ something

I...

- did a lot of proof of concepts, which slip into prod...
- fiddle with all sorts of YAML (prometheus, operator, k8s, vector, otel, ...)
- thought really hard about metrics systems (prometheus and datadog) for SLOs
- wrangled [vector](https://vector.dev/) into a sort-of working state
- learned to dislike Terraform Operator, Cloud, and modules
- reaffirmed my strong distaste of Helm
