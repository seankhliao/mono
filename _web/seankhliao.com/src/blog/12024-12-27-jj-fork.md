# jj for the forking workflow

## jujutsu with forks on github

### _jj_ with forks

At work, I've been test driving [jujutsu (jj)](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/)
as an alternative cli / frontend to git.

At my current place, we work (almost) exclusively on forks:
the main repo lives under the company github org, 
while we push to private personal forks to create PRs.
Working with forks with git was always kind of annoying

#### _config_ for jj

These are various settings I use with `jj`.

##### _config.toml_

This is the [key finding](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/docs/github.md#using-several-remotes)
that convinced me to try using jj for work (again):
by default we pull main/master from the shared org repo,
while pushes go to my private fork.
Plus by default jj won't keep churning tags when fetching from different remotes.

Sure I could setup git to use pushurls but that's extra setup for every repo,
and I keep a lot of repos locally.

```toml
[git]
fetch = "upstream"
push = "origin"
```

##### _aliases_

This lets me jump to the repo root,
since for me it's easier to navigate when thinking about the path starting form the root.

```sh
alias rr='cd $(jj workspace root)'
```

Sometimes I remember to use this to push.
Often the zsh history will just bring up the same thing.

```sh
alias jp='jj git push -c @-'
```

##### _functions_

This switches to the repo on disk,
or clones it with remotes setup properly for forking if I haven't done so already.
This works with my preferred local layout of 
[using worktrees](https://seankhliao.com/blog/12022-06-02-workspaces-with-git-worktree/#worktree).

```sh
function checkout() {
    local org=work-org
    local me=sean
    cd ~
    if [[ ! -d $org/$1/default ]]; then
        jj git clone --remote upstream https://github.com/$org/$1 $org/$1/default
        cd $org/$1/default
        jj git remote add origin https://github.com/$me/$1
        jj bookmark track master@upstream
    else
        cd $org/$1/default
    fi
}
```

This creates a new worktree in a sibling directory,
moving any incomplete work i may have started over.

```sh
function wt() {
    local repo_root=$(jj workspace root)
    cd "${repo_root}"

    jj git fetch
    jj rebase -r @ -d master
    jj bookmark set stash -r @
    jj new master

    p="$1"
    if [[ "${p}" == "$(basename "${p}")" ]]; then
        p="../${p}" # single element, make it a sibling
    fi
    jj workspace add -r master "${p}"

    cd "${p}"
    jj squash -f stash
    jj bookmark forget stash
}
```
