### _10_ months on the job

This is so longa ago that i've forgotten I'd done these things:

- discover broken database networking setups and fixed it
- microsoft teams chatbot
- tls expiry prometheus exporter
  - and a bunch of TLS certificate changes
- less NATs in GKE
- security, IAM, cleanup, audits and consistency
- basically rethink our entire oncall alert routing

So more automation and ensuring our existing automation actually worked.
And all the usual "i discovered it was broken and then fixed it" PRs.
Also seem to be getting a lot more bored these days...

And vendors... 3 months and my request for a firewall change is still not done.
