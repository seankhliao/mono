# Agit-flow

## something gerrit like

### _Agit-Flow_

It may seem small, 
but one of the reasons I like [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) 
is that a CL (change list) is created automatically on push from the git cli.
This is unlike Github, where pushing a new branch 
will result in the server sending you a link to create a new PR in the web ui.

So when I heard about [Agit-Flow](https://git-repo.info/en/2020/03/agit-flow-and-git-repo/)
and its support for the gerrit-like workflow of `git push HEAD origin:refs/for/main`,
I was excited at the prospect of not having to run gerrit itself
(it's java, and I don't like having to setup its auth layer).
It was also mentioned that [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/agit-support/)
has limited support for it.

Upon further reading...
I realized what git core support meant: 
when the `git` running as the server is setup with `receive.procReceiveRefs refs/for`,
pushes trigger the `proc-receive` which take over updating the refs.
No implementation of `proc-receive` is given,
and you still need a code review system in place to make use of it properly.

So you get the building blocks for building a gerrit-like system using git instead of jgit,
but not full cli-oriented workflow.
