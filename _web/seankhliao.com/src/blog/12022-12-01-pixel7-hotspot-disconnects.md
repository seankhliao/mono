# pixel7 hotspot disconnects

## Frequent disconnects on laptops wifi when using the Google Pixel 7's hotspot

### _Pixel_ 7 hotspot

I semi-frequently work in coffee shops,
there's a nice buzz to them.
They don't necessarily always have decent wifi...
so using my phone as a hotspot has been a must.

The problem is that since switching to a Pixel 7,
my laptops could never stay connected to the hotspot.
They would just drop, and flipping every toggle in the hotspot settings didn't help.

What I later realized was that I've always had my headphones on,
connected via bluetooth, streaming music.
If I didn't stream music, the connection was stable.
Conclusion? use something else to play music when working with hotspot.
