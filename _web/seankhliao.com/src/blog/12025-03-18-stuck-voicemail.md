### _voicemail_ stuck

Two days ago,
my phone started showing a persistent notification about a new voicemail.
Unfortunately, when I called to check for voicemails,
nothing was there,
Regardless, the notification stayed, 
and noisily re-notified me every time my phone went offline and came back online,
which on the London tube, was quite often.

Disabling phone notifications didn't help,
and Android didn't let me turn off some voicemail related notifications.
Turning off voicemail with my phone provider didn't work either.

What finally worked was calling from a different phone
(or in my case, a second eSIM),
leaving a voicemail, and then listening to and deleting it.
