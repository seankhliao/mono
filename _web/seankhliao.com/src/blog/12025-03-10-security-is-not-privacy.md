### _security_ is not privacy

A good example of this might be [signal messenger](https://signal.org/).
Signal is widely recognized as secure:
no outside party can observe or modify the contents of the messages
between you and its intended recipient.
However, it trades off some privacy for usability:
your phone number is your identity,
you have to give it your phone number to sign up,
you only have one identity between all your contacts.
By using signal, 
you have a secure tunnel of communications to your trusted contacts,
but you can't really use signal to hide your identity
from the people you're contacting.

A place where people might get this mixed up is with Google.
Google is a vast entity with many products,
including things like gmail, and ads.
Google's security is generally treated as world class,
nobody outside of the intended actors (you or Google) will have access to your account.
But note how the intended actors includes Google,
this is where they score lower on privacy.
You can't really hide your identity from Google.
