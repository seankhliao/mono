### _rss_ unavailable on this blog

Very rarely, someone asks if I can add an RSS / Atom feed for by blog.

Since this is a static site generated using a custom generator,
making an rss feed available means I'd have to go implment one.
It's not hard, I've done it in the past.
I already generate the [blog index page](/blog/),
so generating another page for rss isn't that much more work.

I've thought about it a lot,
but in the end I've decided no.
If someone wants to subscribe to an rss feed,
I think it implies they found some article to be of high enough quality,
and expect future articles to be of similar quality.
That's pressure I don't need.
While I call this my blog,
it's more like a timestamped experiment / thought log,
where I go dump information I want to retrieve later.
I don't want to think about what happens if I decided to dump a lot of text and spam someone's feed reader,
or if I post some half finished work.

To me, each post should stand on its own,
and not live or die because some previous post happened to be good.
So there's no rss feed,
and there's analytics on this site to give me a rough idea of what's popular.
