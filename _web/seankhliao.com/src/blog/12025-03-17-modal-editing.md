### _modal_ editing

Google Pixel phones recently gained a 
[Linux Terminal](https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/13/android_15_linux_debian_terminal/).
Well to use it,
you usually need to edit files.
With a virtual keyboard,
you can't press key combinations like you can on a physical keyboard.
You have to select the modifiers first,
which if you think about it,
is much more like modal editing.
`vim` for the win.
