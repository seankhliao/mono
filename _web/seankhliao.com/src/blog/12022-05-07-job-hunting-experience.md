## things to do when you need money

### _job_ hunting

Things i experienced when looking for someone to pay me.

_recruiters:_ right now, I think if they don't work directly for the company,
they're not worth the effort to talk to.

_process:_ with scheduling, most take ~1 stage / week, with 3 stages (chat, tech, chat).
What's variable is the part after the final stage, and it can be slow.....
I think if it takes too long, it's probably not worth it either (a view into company efficiency).

_tech_ round: I think I've had a few initial requests to do leetcode,
a few take homes to write code,
but the majority have been system design whiteboarding.

#### _job_ 1

Me: fresh out of school (Msc), 0 work experienc,
and in the Netherlands
(meaning I didn't speak Dutch and needed visa sponsorship in the future).
Also, this was 6 months into a global pandemic...

I mostly targeted local (Amsterdam) area companies,
which to be honest, the market isn't great.
Response rates were low and generally slow,
and I actually only got a single proper job offer...
(I did get another one ~6 months later).

#### _job_ 2

Me: 1 year of experience, bored with the Netherlands,
world is indecisive about whether the pandemic is over.

I spread out job applications across Europe,
with a bit of Germany, Switzerland, Nordics, but a stronger focus on the UK/Ireland.
I think I got a similar response as the first one,
difference being that it was mostly large companies that were interested
/ willing to go through immigration.
I got 2 solid offers here, neither were great on salary...

#### _job_ 3

Me: 1.5 years of experience, based in London.
I was on a visa, but any new employer would still need to sponsor the visa.

I don't know if it's just the market,
or because I look like I have more experience, I got aws certs,
or I wrote more (less edgy?) text in my CV,
but I got a near universal positive response to just posting my cv,
with the majority responding within 3 days.
I did manage to get 3 offers here.
