# go contributor summit

## nyc edition

### _go_ contributor summit, nyc

Another round of meeting people,
and this time as it was in NYC where the majority of the Google Go team is based,
I got to meet a lot of people.
Some people I didn't expect to see,
and some external contributors too
(though not as many interesting ones).

The morning was a slightly more structured discussion
of various topics people wanted to talk about.
There are meeting notes somewhere...
For me,
the more interesting ones were around external contributor friction,
and the proposal process, which is a known bottleneck.

From lunch bleeding into the afternoon,
it was just unstructured chatting with various people about the parts that they work on.
As I kind of fall into the general purpose pool...
I was listening more of the time I think?
I tocuhed on security, cmd/go, and maybe a bit more into general project health.
