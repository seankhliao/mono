### _job3_ 26 months

So summer vacation rolls around,
except that the British weather wasn't very summer like.
We kick off July with a team change,
SRE gets disbanded and I join Cloud Core for the foreseeable future.
In reality... I saw this coming from a mile away,
so nothing unexpected,
and joining the team just means 
a slightly different set of projects to focus on,
I still treat the entirety of the infra group as my domain.

What did we do during the summer then?
More Istio rollout to production clusters,
bring your own key migrations in AWS,
and quality of life improvements spread around the rest of the infrastructure
with things like external links in UIs,
Kyverno testing setup in CI,
and log collection / processing.
