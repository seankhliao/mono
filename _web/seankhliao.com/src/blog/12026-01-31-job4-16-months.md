### _job4_ 16 months

So December is the usual slow month,
and I was out for most of January on holiday.
What I got done was setting up [gitops-promoter](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/gitops-promoter)
for cross environment change promotion,
and ArgoCD Source Hydrator for deploying with fully rendered manifests.
This will probably continue on for the next few months in productionizing it...
