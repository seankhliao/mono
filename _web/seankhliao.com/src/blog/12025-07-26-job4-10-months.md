### _job4_ 10 months

What have I been doing the past 2 months?
Or even past year since I had to do my mid year performance check in...

The usual on call things.
Network design, though waiting for approvals is slow.
More meeting coworkers, this time in Taiwan.
And a lot of time spent on investigating performance bottlenecks,
validating what a solution might look like,
and only now just starting to implement the solution.
That is if no more business priority tasks come up...
