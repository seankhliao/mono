# breaking habits

## changing environment

### breaking habits

I've been traveling around quite a bit for the past 2 months,
which while fun, comes with its own set of challenges.
My schedule frequently changes:
on vacation I wake up anywhere between 6 and 11am,
while for work trips,
out meeting colleagues means a less fixed routine of clockcing in,
doing work, clocking out.
Plus the flying around induces jet lag...

That and having a different environment,
and a reduced toolset available because I pack light has meant
that I broke a few habits,
like watching monotonous video summaries
(though I may have replaced it with watching vtubers...),
not wearing a watch anymore (because it started acting unreliably),
and a different daily healthcare routine (or maybe not having one at all).

Some of these were things I wanted to change,
but I guess mucle memory makes it hard,
where after a long day at work,
you just settle in to autopilot mode,
and before you know it,
things have been done,
and hours have passed.
Changing my environment certainly helped me break some habits.
Now if only I knew how to reliably form new ones.
