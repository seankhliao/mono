### _20_ months at job 3

These past 2 months saw our big cloud to cloud migration finally go ahead.
While the previous 2 were more "let's design and build a new cloud environment",
these 2 were of "how do we move our workloads over".
January was all the application teams worrying about their parts,
and our timelines getting pushed back.
February was when we finally got to do it.

Our migration consisted of 3 core parts:

- external traffic routing: i had near full control over the design and implementation.
- application scale up/down: i sped this up by a considerable amount.
- datastore connection switches: i didn't do much here.

Of course this big project didn't come without its complaints on workload and stress,
especially on the infra team.
