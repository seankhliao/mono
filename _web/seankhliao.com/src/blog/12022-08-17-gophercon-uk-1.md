### _gophercon_ uk day 1

[GopherCon UK](https://www.gophercon.co.uk/)
had sort of started the day before (day 0) with a few workshops.
I skipped those.

#### _talks_

At any given time,
it was either a keynote with everyone in a big room,
or split into 3 different talks.

Overall, a pretty solid first day.

##### Engineering Innovation - why constraints are critical

Saying that you can build off of concrete constraints and not abstract or divergent ideas.
Not too interesting

##### TinyGo: Getting the upper hen

Basic intro into TinyGo with a pracical IoT usecase of temperature/humidity recorder.
Fun, because it's something I don't do.

##### Obscure Go Optimisations

Profile and get rid of memory allocations.
Not just the obvious ones, but also through indirect things
like interface and slice conversions / wrapping.
Also, lift easy things out of loops.
Dives into parts of the runtime you usually don't think about,

##### Deep dive into Go's build system

Can you read `go build -x`?
Also `GODEBUG=gocachehash=1`.
Also`-toolexec`.

##### Protocol Buffers- A Banked Journey

Use `buf`, they make good protobuf tooling.

##### eBPF Superpowers for Go programmers

What is eBPF and how you'd want to use it with Go.
Technically I've heard this talk a few times,
but [Liz Rice](https://twitter.com/lizrice)
is an amazing speaker.

#### _socials_

The speakers stuck around for at least a bit,
so there were opportunities to talk to them
(still want to gush over Liz...).
Other than that,
day 1 was mostly meeting with people I knew from online:
so what appears to be half the [CUE](https://cuelang.org/) team:
[Daniel Marti](https://twitter.com/mvdan_),
[Paul Jolly](https://twitter.com/_myitcv),
[Roger Peppe](https://twitter.com/rogpeppe),
[Marcel van Lohuizen](https://twitter.com/mpvl_).
Also [Bill Kennedy](https://twitter.com/goinggodotnet)
and [Mat Ryer](https://twitter.com/matryer).

I drank a bit too much and my head hurt.
