## build binutils

### standard build unit

[Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)
has an interesting way of measuring how long it takes to do things.
Since most of your time is going to be spent compiling C code,
everything is measured in
[Standard Build Units (SBUs)](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable-systemd/chapter04/aboutsbus.html),
or the time it takes to build [`binutils`](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/).

At the time of writing,
the instructions are:
In short, grab `binutils`, unpack, configure, and compile (adjust `-j` to number of CPUs).
Dependencies include `gcc`, `libc6-dev`, `texinfo`... 
(the configure step will fail if it's missing dependencies).

```sh
$ curl -LO https://sourceware.org/pub/binutils/releases/binutils-2.41.tar.xz
$ tar xvf binutils-2.41.tar.xz
$ cd binutils-2.41
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ ../configure --disable-nls --enable-gprofng=no --disable-werror
$ time make -j 16
```

On my [Framework 13](https://frame.work/gb/en/products/laptop-diy-13-gen-intel) 
with a `12th Gen Intel i7-1260P (16) @ 4.700GHz` CPU,
running `gcc version 13.2.1 20230801 (GCC)` from Arch Linux,
1 SBU is `make -j 16  181.20s user 24.22s system 607% cpu 33.802 total`,
or 33 seconds wall clock time.

On my newly acquired 
[Lichee Pi 4A](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lp4a.html) 
with a `TH1520, 12nm, RISC-V 2.0G C910 x4` CPU,
running `gcc version 13.2.0 (Debian 13.2.0-4revyos1)` from Debian / RevyOS,
1 SBU is `make -j 4  953.23s user 197.58s system 322% cpu 5:56.51 total`,
or 6 minutes of wall clock time.
