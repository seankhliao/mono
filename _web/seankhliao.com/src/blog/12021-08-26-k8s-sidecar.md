# kubernetes sidecar containers

## i heard you like sidecars so i got a sidecar for your sidecar

### _kubernetes_ multiple containers

Usually you have 1 service per Deployment/StatefulSet
which runs in a single container.
If you have any sidecars that need to run with it,
you add it to the list.
But do you add it before or after your service?

#### _docs_

While the docs say that initContainers are run serially,
no guarantee is made on how the main containers are run.
There's an open issue to support [dependencies between containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/65502).

Right now, they're started serially,
but there have already been attempts to start them in parallel.

#### _implementation_

The important parts are in `kubelet/kuberuntime`,
specifically:
[getting list of containers that need to change](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/edb0a72cff0e43bab72a02cada8486d562ee1cd5/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_manager.go#L635)
and
[starting containers in order](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/edb0a72cff0e43bab72a02cada8486d562ee1cd5/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_manager.go#L927-L930).

This means that you probably want to start your sidecars first if you main service depends on it,
for example starting GCP's [cloudsql-proxy](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudsql-proxy)
first so the service has a DB to connect to.

##### _postStart_ hook

If you look a bit deeper, you'll notice the
[postStart hook](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/edb0a72cff0e43bab72a02cada8486d562ee1cd5/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_container.go#L275)
is run synchronously as part of starting the container,
so if that edge of starting first isn't enough,
you could craft a blocking postStart hook to wait until the container is ready.
