## pushing through correctness

### _job4_ 8 months

I feel like for the past 2 months I've been focusing on correctness.
That is, the blockchains I run day to day pull in data and try to derive some state,
and I've been trying to make sure our derived state is consistent with everyone else's derived state.
Whether that's through block hash comparisons, or more peering,
or other blockchain specific tuning.

Other things I've worked on:

- adding a lot of python type hints (and still having type related bugs)
- on call, and related monitoring changes
- standardizing / deduplicating codebase
- meet the company in nyc
- plumbing tracing through more parts of our system
- reducing DNS NXDOMAIN volume
