### _go_ contributor summit

So there was a [Go Contributor Summit](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/EfmNZZBqmQI)
colocated with GopherCon EU in Berlin this year.
Just as last time, I skipped the conference and only attended the summit.

It was interesting to see a fresh round of people,
some I didn't imagine I'd see irl,
plus a few familiar faces from last time.

It was a two track unconference type event,
I joined disccusions about reviews (finding reviewers is still hard),
proposal process (too many, prioritization problem),
pprof (new apis?),
and pkgsite search + related ux issues.
