### _job4_ 12 months

For the tail end of summer...
it's just been endless performance debugging and fixes.

First off, a blockchain that requires low latency disk,
so no AWS EBS volumes, it has to be a locally attached SSD.
Except that you lose the disk if AWS ever stops your machine,
made much harder with node provisioning by Karpenter.
So I worked on a thing to do automatic snapshots and restores to a S3 bucket.

Next up, a poorly performing chain that just eats up resources
and doesn't backfill and data.
Oh how can you operate a chain if you can't read history?
So a lot of trouble trying to integrate some third party thing that will maybe keep history.

Finally, I got annoyed by getting paged too often for a flaky chain.
As in, it restarts on its own for no good reason.
I described my fix as: stare at the config and use gut feel to choose new numbers that perform well.
Plus a stupid hack to do snapshot restores frequently because pruning doesn't work.

All of that,
plus the usual maintenance upkeep,
and bug fixing because I'm annoyed at renovate randomly opening / closing PRs
or at docker caching taking 5 min...
