# job2 2 months

## what exactly have I managed to achieve???

### _job2_

So, I work for what is essentially an accounting firm
that dreams of being able to sell software services.
This has interesting implications,
like my title technically being _assistant manager_,
even though I don't manage anyone.
As an SRE, it also happens that our team doesn't directly generate revenue,
which for an accounting firm,
feels like we might as well exist to just burn money,
so I'm not sure how we get any funding at all...

Did I manage to get anything done here?
well, I got
[aws](/blog/12022-03-13-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/)
[certified](/blog/12022-03-30-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/)
as a requirement to gain extra AWS access/roles.
I'm doing upgrades for things because once something ran,
nobody wanted to do upgrades.
And I'm looking (with despair) at multicloud,
because trendy
(this was apparently what I was hired for??
I was only informed weeks after I was onboarded).

As for how I feel about all this...
I think I'll leave it for next month.
