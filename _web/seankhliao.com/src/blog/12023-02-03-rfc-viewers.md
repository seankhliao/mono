## Where do you look for RFCs online?

### _IETF_ RFC viewers

So you have an RFC, where do you link people to?

Let's take an example RFC, RFC 9114 "HTTP/3"

- [datatracker.ietf.org](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9114/):
  this will show a timeline of the RFC's status since it was an Internet Draft I-D,
  with links to rendered versions of the RFC.
  - [datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114/](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114):
    like the HTML version on rfc-editor, but the sidebar how more info.
- [rfc-editor.org](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9114):
  this is where the content is actually hosted,
  in different versions:
  - [rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114.txt](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114.txt):
    the plain text version, you probably don't want this.
  - [rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114.html](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114.html):
    the HTML version, with linkable headers.
  - [rfc-editor.org/rfc/inline-errata/rfc9114.html](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/inline-errata/rfc9114.html):
    like the plain text version,
    but sections with errata are highlighted and can be expanded with corrections.

Summary judgement: the `datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html` version is probably the best.
