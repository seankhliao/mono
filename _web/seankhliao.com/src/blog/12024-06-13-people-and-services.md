## do we have a service catalog yet?

### _services_ and the people that manage them

The eternal struggle of finding the right set of people that are responsible for a service.
As a fairly typical business,
we use a variety of SaaS vendors,
each of which have their own representation of "teams".
In comes a reorg,
and everything is now out of date.
Have you updated:

- code host team membership
- paging team / rota membership
- monitoring team membership
- incident response team membership
- chat team membership
- hr team membership
- repo code owners
- repo admins
- service catalog owners and team channel links
- paging service to rota mapping
- incident response service to team mapping rules
- infrastructure ownership tags

I'm sure I've missed a few more somewhere.
While in theory,
we should be able to drive team membership off of HR systems,
that may not be desirable all the time,
as people move about (temporarily) without a corresponding official HR change.
For most of us, knowing whether a team even (still) exists can be a challenge.
As the the service to team mappings...
maybe the only way it will work is if we can drive it off one the teams that people will need
(codeowners?).
