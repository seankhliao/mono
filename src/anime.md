Crippling social anxiety?
Super relatable (for me at least).
It truly uses the medium of animation to tell the story in various styles.

#### Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai

Girl and boy like? love? each other but wants the other to be the one to confess.
The start is more lighthearted and fun.
In the final season / movie,
their personalities shift and it feels much more like a standard love story.

Mostly solving mysteries,
I'm impressed how they lined everything up into grand reveals
and mostly trying to keep characters circulating around.

Rewatching this after many years and seeing the stage play,
I think I liked the stage version better...

#### Sousou no Frieren

No big drama, but so relaxing.
I think we can all learn something from Frieren's attitude on life.

Shorts about different magic spells,
mostly fun.
