##### _12023-02-09_ Sonia Stein

We start with a singer songwriter, she was good.
Then a band, which.... 
had a feel of compressed audio where everything is just full blast all the time.
And finally, the star of the show, _Sonia_.
I think it was pretty much what I heard from spotify, but live.

##### _12023-01-27_ Kimbra

A very synthetic(?) show.
Lots of effects up to a point 
where I couldn't quite tell associate the action I saw with the sounds I heard.
Also, quite a bit of talk about inner self and reflection,
but I guess that's par for the course for album launch events.

##### _12023-01-26_ PVRIS 

With _Maggie Lindemann_ and _Charlotte Sands_

One of the shows where I loved every part.
_Charlotte Sands_ opened with what felt like boundless energy,
I expected nothing less and wasn't disappointed.
_Maggie Lindemann_ was in comparison more muted.
A softer performance that ramped up as it went on,
I think slightly hindered by "not my audience".
And _PVRIS_, I'd been looking forward to this for almost a year.
By the second song there was a mosh pit which generally didn't let up until the very end.
It felt like every song was a hit,
bringing back good memories and making new ones.

##### _12023-01-24_ Kings Elliot

With _Sophia Alexa_

An evening of sad, but not depressing, songs.
The show opened with someone quite forgettable.
Act II by _Sophia Alexa_ felt refreshingly better, 
upbeat in contrast with the lyrics, 
mixing in a hint of country.
The headliner, _Kings Elliot_, brought a much fuller experience.
A rich sound that draws in your attention.
I don't think there could have been a better end 
than the final song with strings accompaniment.
It rounded off the night so well, 
like everything before but turned up to 11.

##### _12023-01-17_ Sofar Sounds

An impulse decision to go in the middle of a
[work kickoff week](https://seankhliao.com/blog/12023-01-15-snyk-kickoff-2023/#-day--3).
Last minute reveals of location and artists to try and build an air of mystery?
60 people in a bar, all seated.
Michael Bird - singer guitarist: not bad, but not really memorable either.
Woodzy - poet: I wasn't expecting a poet for the night,
but with puns abound, it was the best part of the night.
Ruth Brown - singer: a powerful voice,
but I did wonder if the tonal variations were in there just for the sake of it.
Also, way too loud with the audio systems turned up.

##### _12022-12-09_ Pierce the Veil

With _Against the Current_

_Pierce the Veil_ was the headliner, and they obviously had a very excited crowd.
The performance felt more spectacle than music,
with smoke screens, confetti, flying guitars, and general acting out.
Something I've noticed with support acts is
they usually get the short end of the stick in terms of lighting,
and it detracts from the experience a bit.
I also felt like _Against the Current_ weren't quite all in for this show...

##### _12022-12-03_ Halocene and Halflives

This was fun, and I was jumping around quite a bit for both of these.
I witnessed crowdsurfing and playing a song again for the music video.
As the final show of the tour, you can see them all letting go and just enjoying it.
_Halflives_' music seemed most aligned to my taste,
while _Halocene_ seemed a bit more all over the place.

##### _12022-11-24_ UPSAHL

With _Lizzie Esau_ and _Eyelar_

Someone certainly knows how to leverage a live show to create an experience.
Apparently I liked a lot of her songs.
The live versions don't aim to be pitch perfect recreations of the studio versions,
but emotion filled variants enhanced by the stage presence.

##### _12022-11-15_ Nina Nesbitt

With _LonelyTwin_ and _Katelyn Tarver_

It counts as pop (I think), but it's slower than I expected.
Not bad, but not amazing either.

##### _12022-11-10_ renforshort

With _Valencia Grace_

Such an exciting little show.
Not sure what I was expecting but this was fun and energetic and actually knew most of the songs.
Maybe a bit of it is just standing in with the crowd instead of sitting up somewhere far away,
but I loved it either way.

##### _12022-11-06_ Frayle

Another small bar / music venue,
all the scary looking people outside made me wonder if I had walked down the wrong alley.
2 heavy metal bands, then... witch metal? alchemy?
For all 3 bands, many of the songs just felt the same,
with no real differentiation.

##### _12022-11-05_ The Pretty Reckless

With _The Cruel Knives_

They were amazing.
For once, I felt the music pull its weight,
and going to the show is a balance of the music and the experience.
The songs were revitalizing and the crowd was hyped for them.
I think this is the frequency I'm on, I havent changed much since I found them.
O2 Academy, circle front center off right.

##### _12022-11-03_ The Rasmus

With _Overlaps_

It was okay for the night, but a bit bland.
The songs sound like they should have energy,
but I just wasn't really in tune with them.
O2 Forum, balcony center.

##### _12022-09-16_ BANKS

With _Maeve_

The roundhouse, as the name suggests, is round, and gives off circus vibes.
This is the second show I've been to where there are 2 backup dancers dancing around,
they still feel a bit weird...
The lighting felt on point, cementing our focus on Banks.
Alternating between high energy and slow (love?) songs,
overall a bit of a throwback for me (Gemini Feed).

##### _12022-08-25_ Nadeah

A cozy little bar, a little reminiscent of times past.
Halfway bwteen acoustic and rock.

##### _12022-07-29_ London Grammar

Outdoor festival, and with a song catalogue that's a bit ethereal.
_Hannah_ forgetting the lyrics to a song (and feeling bad about it) is fine,
the joy she shows when the crowd also forgets the lyrics to another song
makes it much more human.
Front centre.

##### _12022-07-26_ The Seagull

A theatre show, superfically about playwrights,
but maybe really about feelings around success (or lack thereof).
I went into this blind,
having picked the show based on the lead _Emilia Clarke_.
There are no fancy settings,
just a box, chairs and actors who never leave the stage.

##### _12022-06-29_ Billie Eilish

With _girl in red_

Seated centre back in an arena full of screaming teenage girls (and their guardians)...
The songs flowed well into each other,
and even with the high production experience, it didn't feel artificial or detached.
With a crowd this size, they could just be an amorphous blob,
but it didn't really feel that way,
maybe except when she stands to take in the adoration showered onto her.
Bonus points for coming out much closer to the crowds in a swinging crane arm.

##### _12022-05-19_ Charli XCX

With _Yeule_

We're into the more mainstream hyperpop territory, and it shows.
Polished high production with more focus on the performance and spectacle,
less on the music and crowd.
Front centre right.

##### _12022-05-15_ Fletcher

With _Gracey_ and _UPSAHL_

In a female domninated (90+%?) audience,
I stuck towards the back of the crowd near the sound tech.
_Fletcher_ certainly knew who her fans were,
addressing the crowd directly.

##### _12022-04-10_ Against the Current

With _Halflives_ and _Yours Truly_

After a pandemic and a move to country with way more events,
guess who's back first?
Around mid centre in the crowds, the energy is as high as ever.

This time I actually knew the openers:
_Halflives_ were very similar to _ATC_,
working up the crowd in a similar fashion (high energy bounces).
_Yours Truly_ had a slightly stronger metal lean(?),
I think it took a while for people to recognize them from their songs.

##### _12019-12-08_ Against the Current

_ATC_ again, this time I got VIP tickets because why not?
That got me a 2(?) acoustic performances, a poster, and a photo op.
In the crowd, close to front,
the energy levels are high.

##### _12019-03-19_ Against the Current

One of the first bands I learned to recognize by name,
for this show I sat on the upper floot and mostly just enjoyed the music.
_Chrissy_ is a bundle of energy bouncing around the front of the stage.
