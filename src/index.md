### _hi_

I'm [sean](https://seankhliao.com).
This is me, away from all the tech stuff.

#### _shows_ impressions

Mostly music gigs, occasionally something else to spice things up.

_note:_ dates using the [Holocene Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_calendar)

##### _12022-11-06_ Frayle

Another small bar / music venue,
all the scary looking people outside made me wonder if I had walked down the wrong alley.
2 heavy metal bands, then... witch metal? alchemy?
For all 3 bands, many of the songs just felt the same,
with no real differentiation.

##### _12022-11-05_ The Pretty Reckless

They were amazing.
For once, I felt the music pull its weight, 
and going to the show is a balance of the music and the experience.
The songs were revitalizing and the crowd was hyped for them.
I think this is the frequency I'm on, I havent changed much since I found them.
O2 Academy, circle front center off right.

##### _12022-11-03_ The Rasmus

It was okay for the night, but a bit bland.
The songs sound like they should have energy,
but I just wasn't really in tune with them.
O2 Forum, balcony center.

##### _12022-09-16_ BANKS

The roundhouse, as the name suggests, is round, and gives off circus vibes.
This is the second show I've been to where there are 2 backup dancers dancing around,
they still feel a bit weird...
The lighting felt on point, cementing our focus on Banks.
Alternating between high energy and slow (love?) songs,
overall a bit of a throwback for me (Gemini Feed).

##### _12022-08-25_ Nadeah

A cozy little bar, a little reminiscent of times past.
Halfway bwteen acoustic and rock.

##### _12022-07-29_ London Grammar

Outdoor festival, and with a song catalogue that's a bit ethereal.
Hannah forgetting the lyrics to a song (and feeling bad about it) is fine,
the joy she shows when the crowd also forgets the lyrics to another song
makes it much more human.
Front centre.

##### _12022-07-26_ The Seagull

A theatre show, superfically about playwrights,
but maybe really about feelings around success (or lack thereof).
I went into this blind,
having picked the show based on the lead _Emilia Clarke_.
There are no fancy settings,
just a box, chairs and actors who never leave the stage.

##### _12022-06-29_ Billie Eilish

Seated centre back in an arena full of screaming teenage girls (and their guardians)...
The songs flowed well into each other,
and even with the high production experience, it didn't feel artificial or detached.
With a crowd this size, they could just be an amorphous blob,
but it didn't really feel that way,
maybe except when she stands to take in the adoration showered onto her.
Bonus points for coming out much closer to the crowds in a swinging crane arm.

##### _12022-05-19_ Charli XCX

We're into the more mainstream hyperpop territory, and it shows.
Polished high production with more focus on the performance and spectacle,
less on the music and crowd.
Front centre right.

##### _12022-05-15_ Fletcher

In a female domninated (90+%?) audience,
I stuck towards the back of the crowd near the sound tech.
_Fletcher_ certainly knew who her fans were,
addressing the crowd directly.

##### _12022-04-10_ Against the Current

After a pandemic and a move to country with way more events,
guess who's back first?
Around mid centre in the crowds, the enegery is as high as ever.

This time I actually knew the openers:
_Halflives_ were very similar to _ATC_,
working up the crowd in a similar fashion (high energy bounces).
_Yours Truly_ had a slightly stronger metal lean(?),
I think it took a while for people to recognize them from their songs.

##### _12019-12-08_ Against the Current

_ATC_ again, this time I got VIP tickets because why not?
That got me a 2(?) acoustic performances, a poster, and a photo op.
In the crowd, close to front,
the energy levels are high.

##### _12019-03-19_ Against the Current

One of the first bands I learned to recognize by name,
for this show I sat on the upper floot and mostly just enjoyed the music.
Chrissy is a bundle of energy bouncing around the front of the stage.
