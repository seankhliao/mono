##### _12023-11-20_ Echosmith

With _McKenna Michels_ and _Larkins_

I think _McKenna Michels_ was fine?
Slightly on the slower, sadder side,
which was in contrast to the positive personality.
_Larkins_ sounded like a typical pop/rock band,
not very memorable, I may have drifted off for a bit.
It really was a dream for me to see _Echosmith_,
they were one of the first bands I was into,
and by the time I got around to seeing live shows,
I didn't think they were still active.
Anyway, the music was amazing,
brought back so many memories.
Though I did think I should have refreshed my memory of their discography beforehand.
Soft pop/rock, it felt like a gentle embrace,
and throwback to a more carefree time.

##### _12023-11-09_ Melanie Martinez

With _UPSAHL_

I get to see _UPSAHL_ again,
what's not to love?
We open with a barrage of pop,
slow down for a few sad songs,
then get back into fast paced music.
_Melanie Martinez_ on the other hand felt quite different.
It felt less about the music
(whuch was different from the more dreamy style in recordings),
and more the entire experience of the show.
Every single moment felt planned and choreograhed,
there was no small talk besides a thank you to mark the encore,
and more thank yous at then end;
each piece flowed into the next,
and the use of the digital backdrop in combination with physical setpieces
was quite impressive.

##### _12023-11-03_ Maisie Peters

With _Gretta Ray_

_Gretta Ray_ was slow(er) sad(der) pop.
What went through my head was:
she looks a bit like taylor swift?
_Maisie Peters_ was way better than I expected.
Usually I don't care too much for the talk between the songs,
but the cute, bubbly energy she gave off was infectious.
The music was different from the recordings,
but in a richer kind of way,
and I was pleasantly surprised by how many songs I knew.

##### _12023-11-02_ Fall Out Boy

With _Nothing,Nowhere_ and _PVRIS_

_PVRIS_ felt a bit off...
compared to the many times I saw them this year.
The start of each song felt a but raw,
but generally ended strong.
_Fall Out Boy_ was very flashy.
Lots of big sets and props,
like a spinning starfish, a giant talking dog, and just stuff on stage.
Also plenty of fireworks and flames.
As for the music,
I felt a distinct lack of bass or just lower frequencies in general.
Being around for as long as they have,
there was quite a bit I've never hear of,
the ones I knew were just the popular ones that bookended the set.

##### _12023-10-25_ deathbyromy

With _July Jones_

I might have stood too close to the stage and half the time all I heard were drums...
Halfway through I really did wonder if I was at the right place,
I obviously hadn't gone through their discography beforehand,
but it was still an interesting evening of loud alt music.

##### _12023-10-03_ ari abdul

With _Deadbeat girl_

babydoll was the song stuck in my head all summer,
and it was great seeing it live.
There was definitely a difference between the sweet quiet parts
and the louder, coarser parts we don't get in the recorded version.

##### _12023-09-13_ eundohee

With _Sadie Fine_, and _Chloe Levaillant_

_Sadie Fine_ was... fine? I came for the one song on my spotify playlist (Detox),
and got it. Others sounded a bit rougher than expected.
_Chloe Levaillant_ was my favourite of the trio,
it felt calm and relaxing, giving off ocean or forest vibes.
_eundohee_ was ok? It took a bit for me to catch on what language I was listening to...

##### _12023-09-07_ flamenco

Lively, and loud clapping,
but I can't say I understood the singing parts.

##### _12023-08-29_ UPSAHL

With _clarence_

_UPSAHL_ was one of my favourite shows last year,
and it is most definitely making the list this year.
The atmosphere was what can only be described as electric,
even the slow songs turned into energetic dances.
The crowd sang almost every song,
thankfully we didn't have to jump for every one,
but when we did, it was fun.
Standing at the front edge,
there's definitely peer (crowd?) pressure to join in,
plus you get to have Taylor lean into your personal space...

##### _12023-08-28_ All Points East

With _Kaeto_, _Unflirt_, _Mae Stephens_, _Isabel LaRosa_, _Valencia Gtace_, _Nieve Ella_, _Griff_,
_Paris Paloma_, _girl in red_, and _HAIM_

I wandered into the festival grounds and saw an empty main stage,
wondering where everyone was and if I got there too early.
Making my way to the other end,
I saw _Kaeto_ who set the mood for the rest of the day.
_Mae Stephens_ I was wondering who that was until she got to her last song,
If We Ever Broke Up, and I doubted if I could ever escape the repetitive tiktok musoc.

_Isabel LaRosa_ was coverying BABYDOLL as I approached the stage,
in the set were quite a few covers of songs currently at the top of my playlist,
I loved it.
_girl in red_ was just as good as I remember,
maybe slightly more relaxed than last time,
still very active and jumpy.
_HAIM_ sort of had a face of shock for most of their performance,
I didn't really know their songs,
but it was still enjoyable.

##### _12023-08-19_ Field Day

My legs were sore after this.
I feel like I could sort of distinguish between things I liked
and things I didn't,
but it did sort of all blur together a bit too much.

##### _12023-07-04_ Oslo Danse Ensemble

A ballet performance in Oslo.
GONE felt like a collection of scenes,
no strong single thread of a narrative,
but pretty overall.
THE RING felt stronger story wise,
though I can't say I enjoyed the music as much.
Both felt modern-ish,
with a bit more focus on expression,
and less on precision choreography.

##### _12023-07-02_ Blackpink

With _Sabrina Carpenter_, _Rebecca Black_, _The Rose_, _Peach PRC_, _Caity Baser_, and _Annika Bennett_

_Annika Bennett_, the sad songs set of the festival,
but I liked it.
Cool and relaxing.
_Caity Baser_ had a joyous african/caribbean vibe(?)
Not bad, but not my jam.
_Peach PRC_ was, by contrast, wilder, with fairy wings and catchy songs (I think).
_The Rose_, a K-POP boy band,
it was fine I think.
Just fine.
_Rebecca Black_ felt like forever trying to outrun a dark history (Friday...),
which came back as a remix(?) in the penultimate song.
I'm not sure what I was expecting, but she gave off a feeling of wanting to be more mature.
_Sabrina Carpenter_ I could barely see her on stage (sooo many people),
but I still loved the set.
I think her speaking voice was slightly deeper than expected,
singing was just like the records.
_Blackpink_ was... so much screaming and singing from the fans.
I think I recognized a surprising number of their songs,
and the visuals were over the top in a good way.
High production at its best.

##### _12023-06-20_ Beth McCarthy

With _lleo_, and _carpark_

I think the music for the night was fine.
_Beth_ was palpably excited.

##### _12023-06-13_ Taylor Acorns

With _Uninvited_

Active, intense.
I don't think I've heard much of her songs before then,
but it was good fun for the night.

##### _12023-06-09_ PRINS

With _Jayd Marie_, _Detweiler_, and _Lekna_

My hopes weren't high when I saw the venue was one of the smaller ones,
but it was surprisingly good.
Catchy and enegertic,
with a cooperative audience that danced along.

##### _12023-06-06_ Royal Philharmonic Orchestra

With _Aisling McGlynn_

A concert of video game music played by an orchestra,
it was as amazing as it sounds.
Having been to way too many rock converts recently,
it was a good reminder that there are a lot of other instruments
than a guitar, bass, and drums.
A few moments were, "oh so that's how those sounds were made".
To top it off was the ethereal voice of _Aisling McGlynn_
for some truly memorable songs.

##### _12023-06-03_ PVRIS

Apparently already my third _PVRIS_ show of the year.
This time an acoustic solo session by Lynn.
It's lovely to hear the focals so clearly.
And the contrast between her voice in talking (soothing),
and singing (strong?), is just so cute.

##### _12023-05-27_ Slam Dunk Festival

With _LØLØ_, _Scene Queen_, _Charlotte Sands_, _Maggie Lindemann_, and _PVRIS_

With 5 main stages (3 of which were double stages with to minimize downtime),
I thought I'd have a nice variety,
but I pretty much ended up just staying at a single stage for most of the day.
_LØLØ_ was a fun, energetic performance that set the mood.
_Scene Queen_ was interesting (bimbocore?),
though I'm not sure if I'd voluntarily listen to it again.
_Charlotte Sands_ was once again a set I loved,
noticeably messier this time.
_Maggie Lindemann_ was who I came for (front row anyone??).
A solid, powerful voice, though with less deviation from studio versions.
And finally, _PVRIS_ on the main stage,
maybe I was too far on the edge but the crowd didn't feel as into it,
but I enjoyed it.

##### _12023-05-25_ Cherry Dream

I think the real audience was just me and 4 other people,
with everyone else being either one of the performances
or staff.
Slightly uncomfortable experience tbh.

##### _12023-05-17_ Nessa Barrett

With _briskin_

In a narrow room with bright lights (Heaven is a nightclub after all...),
I could barely see _Nessa_ through the crowd,
but the show itself was still great.
Sad-ish pop songs hits the feels,
and the audience sang along for almost all of it.
An experience for sure.

##### _12023-05-09_ Avril Lavigne

With _phem_

_phem_ was... fine?
Not bad, but also not especially memorable,
besides the oversized mask she came on stage with.
_Avril_ on the other hand... so many memories.
Someone next to me said:
"everyone here either has Avril as a childhood hero or childhood crush",
and i could totally believe that.
There were a lot of throwbacks in the music,
and they weren't perfect deliveries of the studio versions,
they all had that live twist.
Every song was a hit,
and i think this ranks among the best show i've been to this year along with _PVRIS_.

##### _12023-04-30_ Harvey Parker trust: love in mind

With _Clean Bandit_, _Chineke Orchestra_, _National Children's Orchestra_, and more

The launch event for a trust dedicated to the mental health of artists (musicians).
There was a wide range of shows,
some things that I can appreciate, like orchestras,
and others that I wouldn't go see on its own (spoken word, solo instruments).
Of course the highlight was the final performance,
a combination of the orchestras, a choir or two,
and _Clean Bandit_.
It was a full, rich sound,
but I can't help but feel the distinctness I expected was drowned out by everything else.

##### _12023-04-26_ girli

With _Louis III_

Chill, smooth were the vibes I got out of _Louis III_,
good, but doesn't really hook me in.
_girli_ on the other hand felt better than expected,
with contrast between the quiet and loud parts.
It was... therapeutic.

##### _12023-04-22_ Delain

With _Xandria_

_Xandria_ was... noise like a stormy day,
with a ray of sunshine piercing through the clouds.
Or at least that was what I thought of the vocals,
and a bonus point of the voice being more like an instrument
is that they don't ask the audience to sing along.
Compartively, _Delain_ was a more rowdy,
less contrasty affair.
Popular sounding, but less distinct.

##### _12023-04-19_ Ava Max

With _emlyn_

_Ava Max_ was pure pop ecstasy,
fun and energetic throughout,
though it did seem to lean more heavily into dance compared to a pure music show.
The music was a pretty faithful reproduction of the recorded versions,
with a heavy mix of backing vocals.
Oh, and for some reason, there was a dense population of gay male couples.

##### _12023-04-15_ skillet

With _Eva Under Fire_, and _Like a Storm_

I think _Eva Under Fire_ was one of the bands that YouTube just decided I must like one day,
and it wasn't wrong.
Their live performance was a pretty faithful rendition of the recorded versions.
_Like a storm_ was... meh. I never really got into it,
and it sort of just blended together into the background.
_Skillet_ started off strong with energy and flashy visuals,
but somewhere around the halfway point,
they lost of a bit of momentum and never quite recovered.

##### _12023-03-29_ emlyn

With _Beth McCarthy_

I loved the support act,
enegetic, excited, yet it gave off a relaxed overall vibe
that was just pleasant to be around.
On the other hand,
from the moment _Emlyn_ came on,
it was a full on intense barrage.
It felt a bit too much for a full night,
but it was great for the more popular songs where the audience sang along.

##### _12023-02-17_ Anna of the North

With _Rebmoe_, and _Eden Hunter_

We start with a digiatl bedroom vibe,
feels a bit like a throwback.
Then into some pop, which was fine.
Finally, we have _Anna_.
There's a nervous/excited energy in the air and I'm there for it.
The only reason I'm here has been Youtube's constant recommendations of her music videos,
I guess they were worth it.

##### _12023-02-16_ Zoey Lily

With _Elena Flury_

Best described as a chill night out,
away from the banging drums I've been hearing for the past few weeks.
Both are beautiful voices,
makes me want to look for more acoustic sessions.

##### _12023-02-14_ Caroline Polachek

Heavy on the visual imagery,
this was I think a night of pop music.
There was a DJ set as support,
still don't know who it was.
As for the main event,
it felt good, but not amazingly memorable.

##### _12023-02-11_ XYLØ

This was a much smaller show than I expected, with no support act.
Also, I happened to be surrounded by the friends and family group,
which was interesting.
The show itself was great,
though the start/end of it all was sudden.
Mostly what I remember from the released versions,
and it didn't hurt that I was right up at the edge of the stage.

##### _12023-02-09_ Sonia Stein

We start with a singer songwriter, she was good.
Then a band, which....
had a feel of compressed audio where everything is just full blast all the time.
And finally, the star of the show, _Sonia_.
I think it was pretty much what I heard from spotify, but live.

##### _12023-01-27_ Kimbra

A very synthetic(?) show.
Lots of effects up to a point
where I couldn't quite tell associate the action I saw with the sounds I heard.
Also, quite a bit of talk about inner self and reflection,
but I guess that's par for the course for album launch events.

##### _12023-01-26_ PVRIS

With _Maggie Lindemann_, and _Charlotte Sands_

One of the shows where I loved every part.
_Charlotte Sands_ opened with what felt like boundless energy,
I expected nothing less and wasn't disappointed.
_Maggie Lindemann_ was in comparison more muted.
A softer performance that ramped up as it went on,
I think slightly hindered by "not my audience".
And _PVRIS_, I'd been looking forward to this for almost a year.
By the second song there was a mosh pit which generally didn't let up until the very end.
It felt like every song was a hit,
bringing back good memories and making new ones.

##### _12023-01-24_ Kings Elliot

With _Sophia Alexa_

An evening of sad, but not depressing, songs.
The show opened with someone quite forgettable.
Act II by _Sophia Alexa_ felt refreshingly better,
upbeat in contrast with the lyrics,
mixing in a hint of country.
The headliner, _Kings Elliot_, brought a much fuller experience.
A rich sound that draws in your attention.
I don't think there could have been a better end
than the final song with strings accompaniment.
It rounded off the night so well,
like everything before but turned up to 11.

##### _12023-01-17_ Sofar Sounds

An impulse decision to go in the middle of a
[work kickoff week](https://seankhliao.com/blog/12023-01-15-snyk-kickoff-2023/#-day--3).
Last minute reveals of location and artists to try and build an air of mystery?
60 people in a bar, all seated.
Michael Bird - singer guitarist: not bad, but not really memorable either.
Woodzy - poet: I wasn't expecting a poet for the night,
but with puns abound, it was the best part of the night.
Ruth Brown - singer: a powerful voice,
but I did wonder if the tonal variations were in there just for the sake of it.
Also, way too loud with the audio systems turned up.

##### _12022-12-09_ Pierce the Veil

With _Against the Current_

_Pierce the Veil_ was the headliner, and they obviously had a very excited crowd.
The performance felt more spectacle than music,
with smoke screens, confetti, flying guitars, and general acting out.
Something I've noticed with support acts is
they usually get the short end of the stick in terms of lighting,
and it detracts from the experience a bit.
I also felt like _Against the Current_ weren't quite all in for this show...

##### _12022-12-03_ Halocene and Halflives

This was fun, and I was jumping around quite a bit for both of these.
I witnessed crowdsurfing and playing a song again for the music video.
As the final show of the tour, you can see them all letting go and just enjoying it.
_Halflives_' music seemed most aligned to my taste,
while _Halocene_ seemed a bit more all over the place.

##### _12022-11-24_ UPSAHL

With _Lizzie Esau_, and _Eyelar_

Someone certainly knows how to leverage a live show to create an experience.
Apparently I liked a lot of her songs.
The live versions don't aim to be pitch perfect recreations of the studio versions,
but emotion filled variants enhanced by the stage presence.

##### _12022-11-15_ Nina Nesbitt

With _LonelyTwin_, and _Katelyn Tarver_

It counts as pop (I think), but it's slower than I expected.
Not bad, but not amazing either.

##### _12022-11-10_ renforshort

With _Valencia Grace_

Such an exciting little show.
Not sure what I was expecting but this was fun and energetic and actually knew most of the songs.
Maybe a bit of it is just standing in with the crowd instead of sitting up somewhere far away,
but I loved it either way.

##### _12022-11-06_ Frayle

Another small bar / music venue,
all the scary looking people outside made me wonder if I had walked down the wrong alley.
2 heavy metal bands, then... witch metal? alchemy?
For all 3 bands, many of the songs just felt the same,
with no real differentiation.

##### _12022-11-05_ The Pretty Reckless

With _The Cruel Knives_

They were amazing.
For once, I felt the music pull its weight,
and going to the show is a balance of the music and the experience.
The songs were revitalizing and the crowd was hyped for them.
I think this is the frequency I'm on, I havent changed much since I found them.
O2 Academy, circle front center off right.

##### _12022-11-03_ The Rasmus

With _Overlaps_

It was okay for the night, but a bit bland.
The songs sound like they should have energy,
but I just wasn't really in tune with them.
O2 Forum, balcony center.

##### _12022-09-16_ BANKS

With _Maeve_

The roundhouse, as the name suggests, is round, and gives off circus vibes.
This is the second show I've been to where there are 2 backup dancers dancing around,
they still feel a bit weird...
The lighting felt on point, cementing our focus on Banks.
Alternating between high energy and slow (love?) songs,
overall a bit of a throwback for me (Gemini Feed).

##### _12022-08-25_ Nadeah

A cozy little bar, a little reminiscent of times past.
Halfway bwteen acoustic and rock.

##### _12022-07-29_ London Grammar

Outdoor festival, and with a song catalogue that's a bit ethereal.
_Hannah_ forgetting the lyrics to a song (and feeling bad about it) is fine,
the joy she shows when the crowd also forgets the lyrics to another song
makes it much more human.
Front centre.

##### _12022-07-26_ The Seagull

A theatre show, superfically about playwrights,
but maybe really about feelings around success (or lack thereof).
I went into this blind,
having picked the show based on the lead _Emilia Clarke_.
There are no fancy settings,
just a box, chairs and actors who never leave the stage.

##### _12022-06-29_ Billie Eilish

With _girl in red_

Seated centre back in an arena full of screaming teenage girls (and their guardians)...
The songs flowed well into each other,
and even with the high production experience, it didn't feel artificial or detached.
With a crowd this size, they could just be an amorphous blob,
but it didn't really feel that way,
maybe except when she stands to take in the adoration showered onto her.
Bonus points for coming out much closer to the crowds in a swinging crane arm.

##### _12022-05-19_ Charli XCX

With _Yeule_

We're into the more mainstream hyperpop territory, and it shows.
Polished high production with more focus on the performance and spectacle,
less on the music and crowd.
Front centre right.

##### _12022-05-15_ Fletcher

With _Gracey_, and _UPSAHL_

In a female domninated (90+%?) audience,
I stuck towards the back of the crowd near the sound tech.
_Fletcher_ certainly knew who her fans were,
addressing the crowd directly.

##### _12022-04-10_ Against the Current

With _Halflives_, and _Yours Truly_

After a pandemic and a move to country with way more events,
guess who's back first?
Around mid centre in the crowds, the energy is as high as ever.

This time I actually knew the openers:
_Halflives_ were very similar to _ATC_,
working up the crowd in a similar fashion (high energy bounces).
_Yours Truly_ had a slightly stronger metal lean(?),
I think it took a while for people to recognize them from their songs.

##### _12019-12-08_ Against the Current

_ATC_ again, this time I got VIP tickets because why not?
That got me a 2(?) acoustic performances, a poster, and a photo op.
In the crowd, close to front,
the energy levels are high.

##### _12019-03-19_ Against the Current

One of the first bands I learned to recognize by name,
for this show I sat on the upper floot and mostly just enjoyed the music.
_Chrissy_ is a bundle of energy bouncing around the front of the stage.
