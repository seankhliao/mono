### _AWS_ Summit London

I was bored and decided to take a day off and go to 
[AWS Summit London](https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/emea/london/).
It was... full of vendors and AI / LLM hype.

Unfortunately, that meant it wasn't very interesting for us.
I was hoping for some more technical deep dives.
Even the single talk that caught our interest,
on running [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/),
turned out to be mostly about running spot instances,
so not much new things learned.
