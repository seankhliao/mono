### _job3_ 24 months

2 years on the job...
May saw me shifted around projects constantly,
the main achievements were moving a legacy monolith application from reading a config file for secrets
to using environment variables only,
and a related security incident where merged secret / non secret config values were used.

June was SRE time,
like a yearly spring cleaning of bringing everything back up to date,
stabilizing our metrics system's data correctness issues,
and fielding all sorts of istio related questions.
Oh, and getting istio related metrics working in prometheus/kiali and datadog,
plus chasing people down so people have proper access to their production systems.
I did feel the lack of major projects to focus attention to be somewhat concerning though...
